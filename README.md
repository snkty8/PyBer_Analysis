# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

- The purpose of this analysis was to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  Once done, then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results of Analysis

- As seen in the plot, Urban fares were the highest of the three types of cities. Because urban populations are usually higher than other city types, this seems typical. 

- All three city types have a spike in fares on 2-24-2019.  There must have a been a major event taking place in the area these fares were recorded.  This is easily seen in the plot, and the dataframe.

- Simarily, all three cit types show a dip on 03-03-2019.  Depending on the area, there may have been weather related issues going on during this time.
