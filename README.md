# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

- The purpose of this analysis was to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  Once done, then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results of Analysis

- As seen in the plot, Urban fares were the highest of the three types of cities. Because urban populations are usually higher than other city types, this seems typical. 

- All three city types have a spike in fares on 2-24-2019.  There must have a been a major event taking place in the area these fares were recorded.  This is easily seen in the plot, and the dataframe.

- Simarily, all three cit types show a dip on 03-03-2019.  Depending on the area, there may have been weather related issues going on during this time.

## Summary of Analysis
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Throughout this module, there has been no mention of advertisment.  In order to boost sales, especially in the rural areas, it wouldn't hurt to have a few cars phyiscally promote the Pyber service.  By this, I mean cars paint with the logos of the service.

2.  Also, is there an app that advertises the use of Pyber.  This could help boost sales, as well.

3. Promotions for discounts for big events could also boost fares.  Let's say there is a big baseball game going on the in the Urban area.  A build board, promotion on the side of a city bus, or even a bench promotion could help boost sales with word of a discount due soley to the game going on.
